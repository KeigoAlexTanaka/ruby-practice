# Ruby Practice

### Setup

First run `bundle install` in this directory.  This will install everything in our `Gemfile`.  (In this case it's just `rspec`)

### Practice time!

To run the specs, just `rspec test.rb`.  Or you can run `rspec test.rb --fail-fast` if you prefer for tests to stop after the first failure.

Open up `test.rb` in your text editor to read the specs.  (But do not edit them.)

At first everything will fail.  Open up `methods.rb` and make em pass!  **Commit** after you get each spec to pass.

## Bonus

Want more practice?

Define some of the `underscore.js` methods in Ruby!  Specifically, define some [`Hash` methods](http://underscorejs.org/#objects) and [`Array` methods](http://underscorejs.org/#arrays)

Doing this is both fun and really good practice. Try these any time you're learning a new language.
